<h2><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ybSmYMoXQLXVivivaK/giphy.gif" width="80"> A little bit about me...</h2>

My Objective is to work in a meaningful and challenging position that enables me to develop myself as a professional and permits scope for advancement.
I've been working with various programming languages in my curriculum such as **C, JAVA, Python, JavaScript, Ruby etc.**<br>
I'm much more interested in working in an environment where it is all about data. I've been doing <b>Statistics</b>, <b>Advanced EXCEL</b>, <b>SQL</b> etc where there is almost data everywhere.
Simply interested to work in fields like <b>Data Analyst</b> or <b>Data Scientist</b>.
Just want to seek an oppurtunity to apply my knowledge wherever it is possible.
I've worked as an Intern in HPCL and gained a quite good experience while working with a team.
